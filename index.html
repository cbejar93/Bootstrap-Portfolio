              <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of
                light and dark that each give the other one meaning. I like to beat the brush. This is the time to get out
                all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
                You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. What the devil.</p>

              <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Think about a cloud. Just float around
                and be there. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive
                and can experience it. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. It's amazing what you can do with
                a little love in your heart.</p>

              <p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Son of a gun. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. There
                comes a nice little fluffer. You need the dark in order to show the light. There is immense joy in just watching
                - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>
